      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p class="info" id="travel">Nathan has never been one to branch out much and this can be seen in their travel history. Nathan has only ever traveled out of the state when the opportunity almost forces iteslf on them. their first time out of state was apart of their school band trip to Washington DC. This was a great opportunity for them as they were able to get to know their classmates much better. The next time Nathan traveled was apart of a vacation to Wyoming planned by their parents. Wyoming had very few notable features. The two most notable features were Devils Tower, a massive natural pillar of rock, and the vast, flat, and empty landscape across the whole of it.</p>
      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p class="info" id="work">Near the end of highschool Nathan found a job working part time in the warehouse of a nearby furniture store. Nathan would continue to work at this store for about a year before their supervisor informed Nathan that a higher position would be opening. Nathan of course took the opportunity for a pay raise even if it meant shifting to working full time. after working this position for half a year Nathan got the urge to go back to school to get qualifications for their actual field of intrest, Software</p>
