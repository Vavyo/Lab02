### Links and Resources

### Reflections and Comments
* I learned the hard way I need to either clone from github or publish from my computer as id doesnt like having 2 of the same repo.
* I'll just do my Learning Journal here next time and then submit it.
* I was going to make the CSS prettier but it's still a bit too confusing for me.
* I was going to base it off a game called [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) but I realized without knowing the JS behind it it wouldnt work.

* Now updated to fit the lab 3 and lab 4 requirements.


***For lab 4 the driver was Ben Hemann and the Navigator was Nathan Hall***
